## Introduction

This repository presents a constructive model that illustrates how emergent locality arises from the dynamics of informational graphs. By leveraging concepts from graph theory and quantum physics, we aim to provide insights into self-organization and nonlocality. The work here builds upon existing theories and introduces new simulations that visualize these phenomena.

## Key Concepts

### Emergent Behavior

Emergent behavior refers to complex patterns that arise from simple rules. In our model, we observe how local interactions within a network can lead to global properties that resemble quantum-like behavior.

### Informational Graph Dynamics

Informational graphs represent the relationships and interactions within a system. By studying the dynamics of these graphs, we can uncover underlying structures and behaviors that are not immediately apparent.

### Quantum Foundations

This project draws from quantum physics to explore concepts such as nonlocality and entanglement. By framing our model within this context, we aim to bridge gaps between classical and quantum theories.

### Self-Organization

Self-organization is the process where a structure or pattern emerges without a central authority. Our simulations demonstrate how local interactions can lead to organized states in a seemingly chaotic system.

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mennaalshafey/Opolinsky_Emergent_Locality_from_Informational_Graph_Dynamics_A_Constructive_M_of_Q_like_Behavior.git
   cd Opolinsky_Emergent_Locality_from_Informational_Graph_Dynamics_A_Constructive_M_of_Q_like_Behavior
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can create a virtual environment for better dependency management:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Required Data**
   Some simulations require specific datasets. You can find these in the [Releases section](https://github.com/mennaalshafey/Opolinsky_Emergent_Locality_from_Informational_Graph_Dynamics_A_Constructive_M_of_Q_like_Behavior/releases). Download and extract the files into the `data` directory.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the simulations and visualizations:

1. **Run Simulations**
   Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Visualize Results**
   The results will be saved in the `output` directory. You can view the generated plots using Matplotlib.

3. **Modify Parameters**
   Feel free to adjust parameters in the configuration file to explore different scenarios.
